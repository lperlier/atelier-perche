FESTEN agency was born from a collaboration between Charlotte de Tonnac and Hugo Sauzay after they both graduated in interior design from Camondo School in June 2011. 

FESTEN conceives and arranges public and private living spaces as well as scenographic spaces and installations… a variety of universes ranging from places to objects. The context, the original site, the history and the purpose of the place are the starting points for each project Festen undertakes, thus aiming at creating meaningful spaces. 

FESTEN likes to work on the transformation of classical spaces expressed by an enhancement of the original structure, always looking for simplicity and relevance, as well as a bespoke and contemporary understanding of the project.
